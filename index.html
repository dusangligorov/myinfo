            Welcome! This website provides references to my publicly available professional work. Why the simple design?

        <ul>
    <li><strong>Acessible: </strong> Not everyone has high-speed Internet access. You won't find clunky images, videos, or advertisements. This site is mobile-friendly. </li>
    <li><strong>Navigable:</strong> Most of this website is plain text and can be searched using broswer search tools. Every resource on this website is within two clicks. </li>
    <li><strong>Useful:</strong> This website is not a personal sales channel. It contains relevant content and tools for our community, and the vast majority is free. </li>
        </ul>
